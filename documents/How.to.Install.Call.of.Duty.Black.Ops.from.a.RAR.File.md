# How to Install Call of Duty: Black Ops from a RAR File
 
If you have downloaded Call of Duty: Black Ops from a RAR file, you may be wondering how to install and play the game. RAR files are compressed archives that contain multiple files and folders. To install the game, you will need to extract the contents of the RAR file and follow the instructions below.

[**Download**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftlniurl.com%2F2tKEkA&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0FK9vDsh55FFmBh_8VwjXS)

 
## Step 1: Extract the RAR file
 
To extract the RAR file, you will need a software that can handle this format, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can download these programs from their official websites. Once you have installed the software, right-click on the RAR file and select "Extract Here" or "Extract to Call Of Duty Black Ops". This will create a folder with the same name as the RAR file, containing all the files and folders inside it.
 
## Step 2: Locate the setup file
 
Inside the extracted folder, you should find a file named "setup.exe" or "setup-4.bin". This is the file that will launch the installation process of the game. Double-click on this file and follow the on-screen instructions. You may need to agree to the terms and conditions, choose a destination folder, and select the components you want to install.
 
## Step 3: Download and install the day one update
 
Before playing for the first time, you will need to download and install a day one update for Call of Duty: Black Ops. This update is required to access Multiplayer, Zombies, and Specialist Headquarters modes. Blackout mode is fully playable once installation is about 30% complete (approximately 16-20 GB). The day one update package is roughly 50 GB in size and can be downloaded from [the official website](https://support.activision.com/black-ops-4/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-installation-and-setup)[^1^]. Download speeds may vary based on your region, platform, connection type, and internet speed.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the game
 
Once the installation and update are complete, you can launch the game from your desktop shortcut or start menu. You can choose from four different modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies, and Blackout. Each mode offers a different gameplay experience and challenges. Have fun!

## How to Play Blackout Mode
 
Blackout mode is a battle royale mode that pits up to 100 players against each other in a large map. The objective is to be the last survivor or team standing. You can play solo, duo, or in a squad of up to four players. You can customize your character, weapons, and equipment before each match.
 
### How to Start a Match
 
To start a match, select Blackout from the main menu and choose your preferred mode: solo, duo, or squad. You can also join a friend's party or invite other players to join yours. Once you are ready, press the deploy button and wait for the match to begin.
 
### How to Survive
 
Once the match starts, you will be dropped from a helicopter into a random location on the map. You can choose where to land by using your wingsuit and parachute. You will start with no weapons or equipment, so you will need to scavenge for them in buildings, crates, and supply drops. You can also loot items from fallen enemies or teammates.
 
The map is constantly shrinking due to a deadly circle of radiation that closes in over time. You will need to stay within the safe zone marked by a white circle on the map. If you are caught outside the circle, you will take damage and eventually die. The circle will move and shrink at regular intervals, forcing players to relocate and confront each other.
 
You can use vehicles, such as cars, trucks, boats, and helicopters, to travel faster and escape the circle. However, vehicles are noisy and attract attention from other players. You can also use perks, such as Dead Silence, Awareness, and Skulker, to gain an edge over your enemies. Perks are consumable items that grant you temporary abilities for a limited time.
 
You can heal yourself by using bandages, first aid kits, or trauma kits. You can also revive your teammates if they are downed but not eliminated. However, reviving takes time and leaves you vulnerable to enemy fire. You can communicate with your teammates by using voice chat or quick commands.
 
### How to Win
 
The match ends when there is only one player or team left alive. The last survivor or team is declared the winner and receives a victory screen with their stats and rewards. You can also earn merits based on your performance, such as kills, placements, and challenges completed. Merits are used to rank up your echelon level and unlock new characters and cosmetics.
